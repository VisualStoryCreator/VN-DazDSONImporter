# Virtually Naked

The goal of Virtually Naked is photorealistic rendering of naked people at VR framerates.

For instructions on building the code from this repository, please see the [project Wiki](https://github.com/virtuallynaked/virtually-naked/wiki/).

Builds of Virtually Naked can be downloaded from the [Virtually Naked Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/virtuallynaked) (note: contains adult content).

_NB: While the game itself contains nudity, there's no actual nudity or sexual content in this repository. (Unless you find C# sexy...)_
