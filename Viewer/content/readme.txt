VIRTUALLY NAKED 0.5
-------------------

The goal of Virtually Naked is photorealistic rendering of naked people
at VR framerates.

This release is a just a technology demo. Virtually Naked is a work in 
progress and there's still a lot to do. But I'm planning to do regular 
demo releases to show off the current progress and get feedback from 
other Virtual Reality enthusiasts.
